This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution. The original code attempts to access the 'length' property of an object, which may not always exist. This results in a TypeError when the input object lacks this property.  The corrected code adds a check to handle objects without a 'length' property gracefully.  This is a valuable lesson in defensive programming in JavaScript.
